Later, she was diagnosed with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome. This condition includes symptoms such as dwarfism, loss of hair, lack of body fat, and muscle. Hence, explaining her anorexic appearance. According to studies, a child diagnosed with progeria has a life expectancy of around 13 years. However, this didn’t stop Adalia from making the most of her years.</li><li>Adalia’s mother and her stepfather Ryan met one another for the first time during history class in 8th grade at a school situated in Round Rock. The first thing that Ryan said to her was quite inappropriate. Despite that, the two went on to date one another but parted ways in middle school as he had moved to Florida along with his family. They were reunited with one another after Natalie had written to him while he had been arrested for matters unknown. During that, he had received the letter from Natalia and shortly after that came to see Adalia and her mother. Ever since then, they have been together.</li><li>Natalia met Adalia’s biological father during an art class in middle school and started dating him after spending time for only a couple of months. Things got serious between them and during Natalia’s late teenage years she gave birth to her first child Adalia. During that time, Natalia had been a victim of domestic abuse by Adalia’s biological father for quite some time. However, it all ended when Natalia asked him to leave after he had punched her in the arm at a hospital in anger while she was holding Adalia. Her mother revealed the entire situation via a post that was uploaded to Facebook.</li><li>She started her self-titled YouTube channel in June 2012 and the first video she had uploaded was of herself singing the hymn Jesus Loves Me. In May 2019, she had more than 2.2 million subscribers on it. At the time of her death in January 2022, she had reached a subscriber base of 2.91 million subscribers.</li><li>In 2018, Adalia was featured on season 4 episode 1 of BBC Three’s Living Differently.</li><li>As of April 2019, Adalia had not seen her grandmother and her mother’s brothers&nbsp;for more than a year as her mother was in a family feud with them.</li><li>She enjoyed going on road trips and adventures with her family.</li><li>Adalia was very passionate about her wigs and had a marvelous collection of them. She had blonde, dark brown, pink, and black wigs, 2 of which were made from her own mother’s hair.</li><li>Her stepfather Ryan, owns a paint shop and specializes in commercial and residential paintwork.</li><li>Adalia enjoyed watching makeup videos by an aspiring YouTuber who went by the title of “life of Val”. On the other hand, she also liked watching creepy clown videos.</li><li>According to research, only 1 in 20 million people suffer from progeria and in 2011, an investigation done by <i>ABC News</i> revealed that only 80 children in the world were diagnosed with the rare disease. This made Adalia, one of the 80 children.</li><li>She was obsessed with the fictional DC Comics character Harley Quinn.</li><li>Adalia enjoyed doing the twerk and playing with her huge collection of toys.</li><p>Featured Image by Adalia Rose / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqbmqSZlnqzu9KeZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadalia-rose.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fadalia-rose.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fadalia-rose.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fadalia-rose.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadalia-rose.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadalia-rose.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hayden-bonta-obituary-ocean-springs-ms-victim-of-an-accident-in-carroll-county-has-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hayden-bonta-obituary-ocean-springs-ms-victim-of-an-accident-in-carroll-county-has-died.html>Hayden Bonta Obituary, Ocean Springs MS, Victim Of An Accident In Carroll County Has Died</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tsai-ing-wen-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Tsai Ing-Wen | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tsai-ing-wen-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
