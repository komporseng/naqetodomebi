It’s the planetary domination of London, New York, and Washington over the rest of the world. It’s hard to get people to join that or think they have a part in it if you called it the Anglo-American world empire.&nbsp;“Well, there’s something there for us too.” But that’s not what it is;&nbsp;it’s the Anglo-American New World Order.”&nbsp;</p><p>“If humanity has any hope of effecting real change for the better, it will not come from the Madison Avenue false reality makers who’ve cast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barack Obama</a>&nbsp;as the savior of the world. To alter our course from tyranny to liberty, to defeat the corrupt elite, we must get past the puppets and confront the real power structure of the planet.”&nbsp;</p><p>“&nbsp;Twenty years ago, it would not be expected that the New York Times would explain itself. The concept of what accountability.”</p><p><strong>Related Stories Recommended By Writer:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker Net Worth 2022: Inside ‘Hocus Pocus’ Star Made Mega Billionaire Status</a></li><li><a href=#>Tom Joyner’s Net Worth And Income (2022 Updated) – How Rich Is The American Radio Host In Actual</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5a5psSMo6annaNiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./flynn-earl-jones.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./flynn-earl-jones.html>Flynn Earl Jones</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-catherine-cat-wong-from-the-bachelor-season-27.html>Who Is Catherine Cat Wong From The Bachelor Season 27?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-catherine-cat-wong-from-the-bachelor-season-27.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
