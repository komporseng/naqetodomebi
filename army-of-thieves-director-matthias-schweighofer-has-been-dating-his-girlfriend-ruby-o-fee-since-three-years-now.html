Ruby is a well-known actress in German theatre.</strong></p><p>Schweighofer, a German actor, has had a fruitful career thus far, which has led to him accomplishing a lot. Because he was born into a family of actors, he rapidly came to the conclusion that his place should be in front of the camera.</p><p>Later on, he participated in the theatre club at his high school in Chemnitz, Germany, and he credits his parents, Gitta Schweighofer and Michael Schweighofer, for his success in the club. His parents are both theatre artists, and they frequently brought him to some of their rehearsals.</p><p>After completing his education, he uprooted his life and relocated to Berlin, where he has been residing since since. His first performance was in the film picture Changing Skins, which was released in 1997 and was directed by Andreas Dresen. Another one of his projects, You Are Wanted, which was also the first German-language Amazon Original Series, was one that he produced, directed, and starred in (2017). The first season was made available in more than 200 countries and six languages around the world.</p><p>Schweighofer directed the film Army of Thieves, which starred Ruby O. Fee, who is currently dating the 41-year-old actor who goes by the name Ruby and who he has been dating.</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Matthias-Schweighofer--300x300.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-90338 alt="Matthias Schweighöfer" width=460 height=460 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-90338 class=wp-caption-text>Matthias Schweighöfer</p><h2 id=matthias-schweighofer-is-dating-girlfriend-ruby-o-fee><span id=Matthias_Schweighofer_Is_Dating_Girlfriend_Ruby_OFee>Matthias Schweighöfer Is Dating Girlfriend Ruby O.Fee<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-showbizcast_com-medrectangle-4-0 class="ezoic-ad ezfound" data-google-query-id=CK3ghOvm0_sCFQed_Qcd5qYJ3g></span></span></h2><p>Over the course of more than three years, Matthias Schweighofer has been in a relationship with his girlfriend, Ruby O.
