The speculations were rife about whether Chloe and Brooklinn are dating or they are only friends.</p><p>If you are curious about who Brooklinn Khoury is and what is her relationship with Chloe, keep reading.</p><h3><strong>Brooklinn Khoury And Chloe Lukasiak’s Relationship</strong></h3><p>Brooklinn Khoury and Chloe had been appearing on each other’s social media (mostly Instagram) for some time now. There was an Instagram post from back in January 2019, which was the first time Chloe first appeared on Brooklinn’s Instagram. The picture was taken from a distance and the girl with Brooklinn was not recognizable.</p><p>However, there was a cheeky response to the photo from Chloe, that kind of gave it away. In the post, the two of them were visiting some rocky landscape and the captions said “We are so dang small in this beautiful world.” And then there was a cheeky reply from Chloe that said, “I’m super big.”</p><p>Even if Chloe was not the girl in the picture, it was clear that she already knew Brooklinn back then and she did appear on Brooklinn’s Instagram, at least in the comment section.</p><p>The 8 October 2021 pics, which appeared on both Brooklinn’s and Chloe’s Instagram, were more explicit in revealing the intimacy between them. There were two pictures, one in which the two of them were playfully fooling around, and the other in which they were embracing each other.</p><p>The pictures clearly show the intimacy between the two of them but there has been no confirmation from either about their relationship. The captions on the pictures only helped fuel the speculations and did not help much in confirming either of the two possibilities. Brooklinn’s Insta post had the captions “My favorite human.” And Chloe’s had just a heart sign.</p><p>Before Brooklinn, Chloe had another high-profile relationship with American actor and musician Ricky Garcia. Similarly, Brooklinn was with a girl called Eden. Their relationship was very low profile.</p><h3><strong>What Happened To Brooklinn Khoury’s Face?</strong></h3><p>In most of her recent photos, Brooklinn Khoury appears with tape around her nose and upper lip. That was because she suffered from a traumatizing experience. When she was visiting her family in Arizona, a pit bull attacked her and bit off her nose and her upper lip.</p><p>On 7 November 2020, Brooklinn posted a long text about the experience.</p><p>On November 3rd I was severely attacked in the face by a pit Bull, my whole top lip and edges of my nose are completely ripped off. It’s crazy how your life can change so dramatically in the split of a second…<span style=color:var(--theme-color-text_dark);font-size:1.4286rem;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:-.01em>I am scared about my future, or if I’ll ever be able to smile again or eat normally. This is the beginning of a long journey to recovery. I hate asking for anything but It would mean the world if you would pray for me.</span></p><p>There was also a GoFundMe campaign organized by Dan Arakawa on behalf of Brooklinn for her injury recovery.</p><p>Since her injury, Brooklinn has been keeping her face covered, either with masks or tapes. However, she has also been learning to accept herself the way she is. This is what she said in a later post:</p><p>I am not able to change the way I look at the moment, so I have learned to love everything that I see in the mirror.</p><h3><strong>Brooklinn Khoury TikTok, YouTube?</strong></h3><p>Brooklinn Kho uryhad a fair bit of following on social media including Tiktok and Youtube as of Oct 2021.</p><p>Her Tiktok channel’s name was <a href=#>@brooklinnkhoury</a> and it had 58.3k followers and 2.1M likes.
