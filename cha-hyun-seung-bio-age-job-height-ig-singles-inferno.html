The contestants on the Korean show are left on a deserted island with the bare necessities and an opportunity to find love. And the only way to escape this “hellish” place was to pair up and head for date nights in “Paradise”.</span></p><p><span>Talking about his dating history, Cha broke up with his last girlfriend back in 2018. He’s been single ever since. Guess, he’s finally ready to move on and reinvigorate his love life now.</span></p><p><span>The last we saw him, Cha was coupled up with Song Ji A on day 5 and day 6.</span></p><p><span>Previously, Song and Kim Hyeon-Joong went for the date night in “Paradise” on day 1 and day 2, after mutually choosing one another.
