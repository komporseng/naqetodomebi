Infact, all three judges got out of their seats to hug Elijah as Luke said, “The last person I saw approach singing like you was Willie Spence.”</span></p><p><span>The other connection between Willie and Elijah is that they’ve both been in horrific traffic accidents. And this was exactly what got Lionel. Plus, the soulful notes Elijah kept on hitting, “I thought of Willie and from then on, I couldn’t recover. I was trying to look dignified and then you beat me up some more. Let me just tell you this, God brought you back nine times for you to do something amazing. I am so glad you are here with us. That was just one of those moments in my life that I will never forget,” Lionel explained.</span></p><p><span>Katy then said, “Elijah, do you understand that this is the beginning of your story? I can’t believe you came to us. How the heck did you come to us?” before Elijah revealed it was his mother who had signed him up to audition before the accident.</span></p><p><span>Obviously, the judges invited his mom in and praised him even more. “Your son, when he opens his mouth, he’s divine. God brought him back for a purpose in life, and it starts right here. Well, God bless you, and your family, and that golden child right there.” Lionel said.</span></p><p><span>In the weirdest of coincidences, Elijah interrupted Lionel and revealed that even in the hospital he was called the “Golden Child” because his hair was gold at the time.</span></p><p><span>After receiving the America platinum ticket award, Elijah then promised to not let anyone down.</span></p><h3><b>Elijah McCormick Car Accident</b></h3><p><span>It was June 8, 2019, when Elijah McCormick got into a serious car crash, three hours after his graduation. His vehicle crashed and caught fire on his way home.

I am not supposed to be here. I have to fulfill my purpose. I am going to go out there and give it everything I have, leave everything on the floor. I am going to leave with no regrets,” he on </span><i><span>American Idol</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Another surprising thing is that the whole time Elijah was at the UNC Hospital in Chapel Hill and even when he returned home, he never once was in pain. “Life is too short and can be taken from anyone at any moment …I just want to say thank you lord for covering me in the midst of it all,” he added.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Elijah McCormick?</b></h3><p><span>Elijah McCormick was 21 years old when he appeared on </span><i><span>American Idol</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>He was in a terrifying accident back when he was 18.</span></p><h3><b>Elijah McCormick Job</b></h3><p><span>Elijah McCormick is a musician.

We appreciate everything you do, what you do for us does not go unnoticed!
