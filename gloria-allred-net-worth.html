She has gained attention for taking frequently controversial cases over her four-decade legal career. Allred has represented numerous clients in suits against celebrities, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Tommy Lee.</p><p>Beyond her work as a lawyer, Allred co-hosted a radio talk show with Mark Taylor on Los Angeles’ KABC.</p><h2><span id=Gloria_Allreds_Background>Gloria Allred’s Background</span></h2><p>Gloria Allred, born in 1941 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was raised in a Jewish working-class family. Her mother was a housewife and her father was a salesman. Allred attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls and later graduated with honors from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in English. She then pursued a graduate degree at New York University, where she became interested in the civil rights movement. After obtaining her master’s, Allred worked as a teacher in Los Angeles while also working for the Los Angeles Teachers Association. In 1968, she began attending Southwestern University School of Law and later transferred to Loyola Marymount University’s School of Law. She was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1975.</p><h2><span id=Gloria_Allreds_Legal_Career>Gloria Allred’s Legal Career</span></h2><p>In 1976, Gloria Allred co-founded the law firm Allred, Maroko & Goldberg. Her early cases included representing children and parents in a lawsuit against Sav-On Drugstore, trying to stop the gender-segregation of toys. In 1981, she famously presented a chastity belt to California State Senator John G. Schmitz during a hearing on outlawing abortions. After Schmitz insulted her, Allred successfully sued him for libel. In 1987, Allred challenged the Friars Club of Beverly Hills’ membership discrimination policies, leading to her and five other women being permitted to use the Club’s health facilities.</p><h2><span id=Major_Legal_Triumphs_for_Gloria_Allred>Major Legal Triumphs for Gloria Allred</span></h2><p>In 1992, Gloria Allred wrote a letter to the Senate Ethics Committee urging them to investigate the actions of Oregon Senator Bob Packwood, who had come under fire for sexual misconduct. Due to the pressure she kept on both parties, the Committee eventually voted for Packwood’s expulsion, leading to his choice to resign.</p><p>In 1995, Allred represented 11-year-old Katrina Yeaw in Yeaw v. Boy Scouts of America, which was launched in order to determine whether the organization had the right to exclude girls. Also in 1995, Allred represented Nicole Brown Simpson’s family in the O. J.

Allred successfully argued against Spelling, leading the jury to award Tylo $4.8 million. This pivotal case helped establish the rights of actors to continue to work when they become pregnant.</p><h2><span id=Gloria_Allreds_High-Profile_Cases>Gloria Allred’s High-Profile Cases</span></h2><p>Gloria Allred is a well-known lawyer who has handled numerous high-profile cases throughout the 2000s and 2010s.
