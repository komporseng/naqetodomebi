<time>17 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>MickJagger</strong> is one of those personalities who changed the scene of the music industry forever. With his quirky moves and before the time fashion, Jagger was in his league. But how about his son,<strong> James Jagger.</strong></p><p>Yes, Mick was iconic, but are his children or James able to live up to his legacy. And what is he up to? Bet you have many queries like this piling up as soon as you heard his name. Well, we have some answers to these questions. Get started.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/james-0002.jpg><p>But first, some facts that you might want to know.</p><h2>James Jagger: Quick Facts</h2><table class=facts><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>James Leroy Augustin Jagger</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>34 years</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Date:</th><td>August 28, 1985</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Virgo</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place:</th><td>New York City, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><th>Education:</th><td>Lee Strasberg Institute</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Height:</th><td>6 feet 1 inch(185 cm)</td></tr><tr><th>Hair color:</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Eye color:</th><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Model, Actor</td></tr><tr><th>Social Media:</th><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>How Old Is James Jagger?- Age, Height, and Measurements</h2><p>The fine American actor. James was born in the year 1985, which means he is 34 years old as of now. Jagger celebrates his birthday every year on the 28th of August. Not to mention, he was born under the star sign of Virgo.</p><p>Moreover, Jagger has an athletic physique that stands at the height of 6 feet 1 inch(185 cm). While his other measurements, including weight, are unknown, there is no doubt he is one healthy fellow.</p><p>Similarly, Jagger, who is also active as a model, has an uncanny resemblance to his father, Mick. He has got striking blue eyes, short dark brown, unlike his father’s long locks.</p><h2>Wife and Personal Life: Is James Married or Single?</h2><p>Mick had quite an exciting love life, which the media loves to gossip about. Despite being married and divorced once, Jagger had relationships with many beautiful women. So how about his son, James?</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vera Farmiga Bio- Movies, Husband, Net Worth, Age, Height, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Well, we can say, James is certainly not to his father’s level when it comes to dating and all. Since he has not openly discussed his relationship, we cannot say for sure about this matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/james-0004.jpg><p>However, James used to be a married man. In fact, he was married to artist <strong>Anoushka Sharma</strong>. The couple walked down the aisle in September 2015. Just when their relationship was going all good, the duo called it off and went their ways in 2018.</p><p>After that, James has stayed single and not dated anyone publicly, that is. If he is hiding things about his relationship we are unaware of, we cannot say anything.</p><h2>Early Life, Parents, and Education: Who Are the Children of Mick Jagger? And Where Are They?</h2><p>As mentioned above, James Jagger was born in New York City, New York, the United States of America. He is the son of the famous Mick Jagger and<strong> Jerry Hall</strong>. His parents need no introduction. Mick is an English singer, songwriter, actor, and producer who was a member of the legendary band, The Rolling Stones.</p><p>Likewise, Jagger’s mother was also a famous American actress and model of her time. Together the couple has four children. It also means James has three siblings, <strong>Elizabeth ‘Lizzie’ Scarlett Jagger, Georgia May Ayeesha Jagger,</strong> and <strong>Gabriel Luke Jagger.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/james-0003.jpg><p>Apart from them. James has four half-brothers and half-sisters from his father’s other relationships. Nonetheless, all the children have grown and opted for the profession to their preferences.</p><h4>Feliz Ramirez Age, Height, Grand Hotel, Net Worth, Husband, Dating >></h4><p>Similarly, as for his education, James was a bright student from an early age. Jagger attended Lee Strasberg Institute in New York and trained with<strong> Susan Batson to pursue his acting career.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Earnings and Income: James Jagger’s Net Worth</h2><p>Talking about his net worth, James’s net worth is still under review. However, many online claim it to be somewhere around the line of <strong>$1 million</strong>. Also, his primary source of income turns out to be acting and modeling.</p><p>On the other hand, his father, Mick Jagger, has an astounding net worth of <strong>$360 million</strong>. The former leader of the legendary band, The Rolling Stone, is still active as a singer, songwriter, and director.</p><h2>Professional Career: Running On Father’s Legacy</h2><p>When we talk about James Jagger’s career, there is more to list on his resume. He is an actor, model, and even a singer just like his father. However, his main and foremost priority is acting.</p><p>Likewise, this young man made his acting debut in 2007 at the King’s Head Theatre in London. There he acted in a revival show of <strong>James McLure</strong>‘s two one-act plays Lone Star and Pvt. Wars.</p><p>From then on, James has appeared in a handful of shows. Not to mention, he started his on-screen acting career from the 2010 drama/music film Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll. In the movie, James portrayed the role of <strong>John Turnbull,</strong> followed by another crime/comedy-drama film, Mr. Nice.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amelia Gray Age, Height, Career, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Other than that, James is also busy playing guitar and singing for a London-based punk band called Turbogeist. We hate to say it, but James inevitably falls short compared to his father when it comes to career and popularity.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>– 616 Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57yZqknqtdn66os8SrZJqflWK1prXGoatmr5mbsm68wKucp6yjYsCqrsuipaCrXaOytXnWqKmtoF2YrrOxxKtm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-jagger-age-height-wife-parents-siblings-net-worth-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-jagger-age-height-wife-parents-siblings-net-worth-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-jagger-age-height-wife-parents-siblings-net-worth-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-jagger-age-height-wife-parents-siblings-net-worth-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-jagger-age-height-wife-parents-siblings-net-worth-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-jagger-age-height-wife-parents-siblings-net-worth-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lala-kent-james-kennedy-react-tom-sandoval-ariana-madix-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lala-kent-james-kennedy-react-tom-sandoval-ariana-madix-split.html>Lala Kent &amp;amp; James Kennedy React To Tom Sandoval &amp;amp; Ariana Madixs Split Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rocco-commisso-net-worth.html>Rocco Commisso Net Worth: Do You Know His Main Source of Income?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rocco-commisso-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
