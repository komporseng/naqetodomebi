Singer and lyricist, guitarist and the frontwoman of the anarcho-punk group Against Me!, the group that is famous for its songs such as “Baby, I’m an Anarchist” and “White People for Peace.”</p><p>In 2008, her album Heart Burns featured music that was critical of her conservative president&nbsp;Her 2008 album Heart Burns featured music that criticized conservative presidential candidate <a href=#>John McCain</a>..</p><p>Laura Jane Grace (born November 8, 1980) is an American musician best known as the founder, lead singer, songwriter and guitarist of the punk rock band Against Me!. In addition to Against Me!, Grace fronts the band Laura Jane Grace & The Devouring Mothers, a solo project she started in 2016. Grace is notable for being one of the first highly visible punk rock musicians to come out as transgender, after she publicly came out in May 2012.</p><p>Grace played bass in a band called the Adversaries with Dustin Fridkin and a “revolving cast” of drummers from 1994 to 1996. The lineups were not stable, and the band had various names, including the Snot Rockets, Upper Crust, and eventually the Adversaries. The Adversaries released one (obscure) demo. Their “crowning achievement as a band” (according to Grace) was playing at “The Hardback” in Gainesville, FL. The breakup of the Adversaries led to Grace briefly playing in a band called Common Affliction in 1996. The ending of Common Affliction led to Grace recording the first Against Me! demo tape in December 1996.</p><p align=justify>She got married to the artist Heather Hannoura and they welcomed their daughternamed Evelyn who was born in 2009.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Laura Jane Grace</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Laura</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Grace</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Punk Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1980</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fort Benning</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Heather Hannoura , Tiffany Kay</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Evelyn Gabel</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Laura Jane Grace ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In 1997, at age 17, Grace dropped out of high school and began writing songs, naming the musical project Against Me!. Moving to Gainesville, Florida at 18, she began performing as Against Me!, either alone on an acoustic guitar or with friend Kevin Mahon accompanying by drumming on pickle buckets. Her songs drew influence from early acoustic protest music, covering topics such as class struggle. Early Against Me! shows were played at dive bars, laundromats, and anywhere else that would allow Grace to perform, to audiences of a few or even zero. Making ends meet by working odd jobs, dumpster diving, selling blood plasma, and living in a low-rent house with twelve roommates across the street from an experimental waste dump, Grace also volunteered with nonprofit socialist groups such as Food Not Bombs. She was arrested again at 18 for obstruction of justice and resisting arrest without violence: “I was picking up [Mahon]. He was like, ‘Pop the trunk—I want to throw some stuff in there.’ I was waiting in the car and I saw two cop cars come up behind me. I got out and they had my friend on the ground. I went up to the first officer I saw and said, ‘Excuse me, officer, what’s going on?’ He’s like, ‘Down on the ground—you’re going to jail.’ I started to ask another question and he grabbed me, slammed me into the cop car, and arrested me.”</p><h2>Laura Jane Grace Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Laura Jane Grace is one of the <strong>richest Punk Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Laura Jane Grace</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>When Against Me!&nbsp;started, she was struggling to make enough money to pay for her expenses and was selling blood plasma and tearing through trash.</p><p align=justify>Her track “Thrash Unreal” with Against Me!&nbsp;was a number one song at the top of the U.S. Modern Tracks chart.</p><p align=justify>Grace has said that she is an anarchist. After leaving Naples, Italy and moving to Naples, Florida, Grace said that she discovered punk rock music around the age of 13. Around the age of 15 or 16 years old, Grace said that she also discovered the anarcho-punk and activist punk rock movements, which she found appealing for its feminist and anti-hate stance against racism, homophobia, and its embrace of body liberation. Grace said she has been influenced by these concepts as core values since learning about them. A band that Grace cites frequently as an example of politics and music is Crass, an English art collective and punk rock band formed in 1977. However, as Against Me! became more successful, the constraints of the punk rock scene, which often had rigid sets of rules, were difficult to embrace, especially during the times when Grace was struggling with gender dysphoria.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Punk Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2000, Grace married Tiffany Danielle Kay. The marriage ended in divorce four years later in 2004.</p><p>In 2000, Grace convinced Bowman to move to Gainesville and began teaching him how to play Against Me! songs on guitar. After some early EP releases, Against Me! developed into a full band consisting of Grace, Bowman, bassist Dustin Fridkin, and drummer Warren Oakes. Their debut album, Against Me! Is Reinventing Axl Rose, was released in 2002 through local independent record label No Idea Records. With Fridkin replaced by Andrew Seward, the band signed to DIY indie record label Fat Wreck Chords for 2003’s Against Me! as the Eternal Cowboy and 2005’s Searching for a Former Clarity. The name As the Eternal Cowboy was symbolic of the old fashioned concept of the Western cowboy, always wandering the plains lost and lonely. It was envisioned by Grace as a concept record about love and war.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Laura Jane Grace height</b> <strong>6 ft 2 in</strong> Laura <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 2 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>An arrest at age 14 crystallized her aversion to authority: having gone to the beach on Independence Day 1995 to watch fireworks, “I walked up on the boardwalk, and a cop was like ‘Hey, get off the boardwalk; you’re blocking the flow of traffic’. So I turned around and got off, and he came up to me again and was like, ‘Get off the boardwalk.’ And I was like ‘I’m off the boardwalk.’ ” Grace claims to have then been slammed into a police car, thrown face-first to the pavement, jumped on, hogtied, carried “like a suitcase”, put in a holding cell, not allowed to call her mom at that time, charged with resisting arrest and battery, placed under house arrest for the summer, and required to do 180 hours of community service, all because “I was a dirty, grubby little punk kid with black spiky hair who hadn’t washed his pants in a year.” Grace’s mother hired an attorney, whom she could ill afford, who took the case to court and lost. Grace was charged as an adult and ultimately convicted of both felonies. Grace later said the experience “changed my life. [It] politicized me.” “I have an inherent trust of mankind. I think authority and government base their power on violence. I refuse to recognize anyone’s power over me.”</p><p align=justify>In March 2006, while touring as an opening act for Alkaline Trio, Grace met visual artist Heather Hannoura, who designed merchandise for Alkaline Trio and other bands.
