The record, which peaked at number 14 on the Billboard 200 list, was a huge success.</p><p>Lil Durk’s sixth mixtape, titled “300 Days, 300 Nights,” was released that same year. To advertise this mixtape, the single “My Beyonce” was released.</p><p>His romantic interest Dej Loaf was featured in the song. This mixtape was praised by critics as a welcome change from his earlier albums, which mainly focused on the drug violence in the area where he was born.</p><p>On July 22, 2016, his second album, “Lil Durk 2X,” was made available. To generate interest in his second album, a single titled “She Just Wanna” with another rapper named “Ty Dolla Sign” was released two months prior to the album’s release.
