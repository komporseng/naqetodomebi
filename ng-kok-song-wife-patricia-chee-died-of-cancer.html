Notably, he served as a director at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) from 1985 to 1986 and as chief investment officer of GIC from 2007 to 2013. In addition to these positions, Ng played a significant role as the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) founding chairman. SIMEX later changed its name to the SGX Group. Due to his skills, he was also appointed to the boards of Temasek Holdings from 2003 to 2005 and SGX Group from 2013 to 2018.</strong></p><h2>Ng Kok Song’s First Wife Patricia Chee’s Cancer Led To Her Demise</h2><p>Ng Kok Song fell in love with Patricia Chee, a classmate from Montfort School, around the beginning of the 1970s. Their adventure through life together began after the two got married in 1972. Three children were born into their partnership, giving their shared life more happiness and meaning.</p><p>However, when Patricia was given a stomach cancer diagnosis in 2003, the couple was faced with great hardship. Their 33-year marriage came to an end in 2005 when she passed away from the illness, despite fighting it with bravery and resiliency.</p><p>In addition to leaving a vacuum in Ng’s life, Patricia’s terrible death drew respect and pity from the public. Many people recall Ng’s commitment and steadfast assistance to Patricia during her most trying times. His concern and devotion for her during those difficult times came to symbolize persevering love in the face of hardship.</p><p>Since Patricia died away years ago, life has offered Ng another chance to discover love and friendship. The recent news of his engagement dragged the past back into the public eye, as many people remembered his commitment to Patricia. People are starting to warm up to Ng finding love and comfort in Sylvie as word gets out, wishing them both happiness and a wonderful future together.</p><h2>Meet Ng Kok Song And Patricia Chee Children</h2><p>Ng Kok Song, who was married to Patricia Chee, is the delighted father of three daughters and one boy. The family suffered greatly after their mother passed away suddenly, but Ng never wavered in his determination to make sure his kids knew they were loved and supported. His children show their undying support for him by standing firmly behind him as he enters the Singaporean presidential campaign.</p><p>It’s evident how committed Ng is to his family. He is a father in every meaning of the word, having taken a keen interest in raising children and assisting them through all the ups and downs of life. This strong link between father and child has surely shaped his perspective on the world and how he makes decisions in both his personal and professional life.</p><p>This relationship will provide Ng Kok Song strength as he pursues the presidency. The ideals he has taught in his children and their support system may serve as a source of inspiration and optimism for him as he embarks on this new phase of his distinguished career.</p><p>The children of Ng Kok Song are obviously with him, even though their precise names and other facts are still unknown. They are with him at press briefings all the time, clearly supporting him in his attempt. Their close-knit relationship, which reflects unity and mutual respect, is demonstrated by this familial support.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Shelby Holliday</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Yoon Chan Young</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Hailey Peters</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>entrepreneur</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Why Fan Thinks Aaron May Chef Is Gay | Family And Net Worth</a></h3>Aaron May is a well-known chef and restaurateur who is renowned for his culinary expertise and lucrative restaurant initiatives.He has appeared on food-related television programs such as "Diners, <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Anushka Sharma Plastic Surgery Before And After</a></h3>Anushka Sharma is a seasoned Bollywood actress.
