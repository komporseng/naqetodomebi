Rick was born to Korean parents and had a pretty decent time. The birthplace of this actor is Washington D.C. Besides his parents, the talented artist has a brother <strong>Karl Yun</strong>. He had a pretty decent time with his sibling.</p><p>Moreover, he belongs to a mixed ethnicity but holds the American nationality.

He stands at the height of 6 ft, but his weight is unknown to the general people. His Korean descent helps him look pretty dashing when he makes up his toned body too. But sadly, we have no information on the vital body statistics.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate Richert Age, Height, Career, Wife, Net Worth, Wiki-Bio >></a></h4><p>Likewise, the talented artist has an athletic body, which suggests that he hits the gym more often than not. Added to all of this, his black eyes and the hair of the same colour completes the whole outlook.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Rick was born in Washington, D.C, and spent most of his childhood there with his family and siblings. He always had the freedom and a sense of comfort around his close ones when he was a child.

Later on, the artist went to the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and obtained a finance degree. All of this took place in the year 1994.</p><h2>Rick Yune Career</h2><p>Every big story starts with a struggle that makes a man pretty successful at the end.

The handsome hunk started modelling and soon became the few American-Korean models to feature in the big brands like Polo and Versace.</p><p>After being a pretty well-known name from his modelling stint, the performer thought of taking it a step further to be part of the acting world. In the year 1999, this actor went to play a significant role in Snow Falling on Cedars. Things went smooth, and he featured as Japanese American war hero.</p><p>After this successful stint, there was no looking back, and this talented actor went on to feature in one of the highest grosser along with <strong>Vin Diesel</strong> in The Fast and The Furious.
