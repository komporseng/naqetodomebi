In 2018, Fey received the Herb Sargent Award for Comedy Excellence from the Writers Guild of America together with frequent collaborator Robert Carlock.

They upgraded to a four-bedroom, two-fireplace pre-war co-op. The spacious pad had 4 bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms, an eat-in kitchen and a library. The place had “a peek” of the Hudson River, and was only about a dozen-block walk downtown to 160 Riverside Drive, where many of the '30 Rock' character’s most memorable mishaps had taken place. Built in 1917, Fey now owns two of the 32 units in the co-op building.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/80e7608e-1af4-4675-80a2-20ed909d2e3a.jpeg><p>In January 2016, the New York Observer reported that Fey had purchased a $9.5 million apartment. The 10-room apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side is situated directly above the Riverside Drive home she currently shares with with husband Jeff Richmond and their two young daughters. The apartment was originally listed for $7.5 million but ended up selling for $2 million more than that. Instyle reported that it also has a master suite with a dressing room and three additional bedrooms, each of which includes its own marble-tiled bathroom. The home also boasts a private elevator landing and two fireplaces that are perfect for chilly New York evenings. There's lots of natural sunlight as the entire pad offers 22 windows.&nbsp;</p><p>Stopping by on Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show' in December 2020, Fey said she bought a Subaru Forester. She said her husband urged her to buy something fun, like a Mini Cooper or a Jeep, but she instead, wanted "a car that looks like a medical sneaker" and one that is "so safe." The base 2021 Subaru Forester has an MSRP of $24,795.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2fc0ce94-79b6-4163-81a4-b78dca61fa3e.jpg><p>Tina Fey showed off an Atelier Versace gown with a 154-carat Bulgari sapphire and diamond necklace that belongs on the neck of the Duchess of Cambridge, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hollywood Gossip</a>, at the 88th Annual Academy Awards in 2016.
